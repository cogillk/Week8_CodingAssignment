        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>I created this Mother's Day card for my lovely mom. I used the Sweet Bloom Hot Foil Plate and Stencils by Pinkfresh Studio.
        First, I hot foiled the background with gold foil. Once that was completed, I used the layering stencils to color
        in the floral elements. The colors used include Ballet Slipper and Coral Reef for the large flowers, Peach Fuzz 
        and Lemon Whip layered together for the smaller flowers, and lastly, Fresh Pear and Grassy Knoll for the leaves. After adding the
        color, I used the pinks and orange on a piece of scrap cardstock and I ink blended three circles, two in orange and
        one in pink. I used the Scrapbook.com Classic Type Alphabet Dies to cut out the letters to spell "MOM". I then cut out a strip of vellum
        and taped it to the top of the card, about a third of the way down. I then glued the letters on top of the vellum and
        the card was complete. She absolutely loved receiving this handmade card, and appreciated the thought that went
        into it.</p>
